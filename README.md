# Step 1: Adjust privacy settings
For accounts you plan to keep, must keep, or otherwise cannot delete, here are some general suggestions for improving your account privacy:
- opt out of third-party sharing
- disable cookies when visiting the website
- use an alias instead of your real name
- use email relay like Apple's [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/create-and-manage-hide-my-email-addresses-iphcb02e76f7/ios) or [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/)

# Step 3: Request information deletion

## Data brokers
Intel Techniques is an excellent resource for this process. I recommend going through their list of data brokers to start purging your information from their databases. Note that this part is not 100% effective, but it becomes more effective the more you're able to reduce your overall digital footprint.

### Some pointers
- Most of these data brokers require you to confirm your request via email. If you choose to use your real email address for the request and that email matches their records, some of them won't require additional verification
- If you prefer not to use your real email address, you can use [10 minute mail](https://10minutemail.com/)
- If they ask you for an id, use [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)

## Everything else
Most websites you have an account with have some sort of privacy policy that allows you to request your information be deleted from their database. In some instances, deleting your account is sufficient, otherwise you may need to send a request to have your information deleted. Note that some websites might not actually delete your information even if they say they have, and law requirements around this vary state to state. To determine if deleting your account also deletes your information requires a bit of sleuthing, but I ususally just search their privacy policy page (cmd + F for Mac or ctrl + F for Windows) for the word "delete."

Example: [adidias.com](https://www.adidas.com/)
- scroll to the bottom of the page
- click on "privacy policy"
- search for "delete" to find the section "ACCESS, DELETE AND CORRECT INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT YOU"
- under this section they you may be able to have your personal information deleted by following the steps under "Your Privacy Choices" at the bottom of their website
